"""Mirror conversation history and memory between a laptop and a bucket.

Additive on both sides: a file present in one place and missing in the other is
copied, never deleted. When both sides changed, the more recently written one
wins — in both directions, so a push from a laptop that has been offline cannot
replace newer work in the bucket any more than a stale pull can overwrite a
newer local edit. Nothing here removes a session or a memory.

Sessions are append-mostly JSONL and memory files are small markdown, so whole
objects are transferred rather than ranges. Downloads land through a temporary
file and an atomic rename, matching how every local store writes, so an
interrupted pull cannot leave a half-written session behind.
